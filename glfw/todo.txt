redo shader class to streamline and add more variance
    add support for variable amounts of shaders, other types of shaders, and individual shader files
create material class to build off of texture class and create simpler texturing
add cameras as pass-by-value view matrices
add basic input detection beyond what is included in <windows.h>



batch rendering:

40, 50 origin		10, 20 size

0, 0
0, 20
10, 20
10, 0

0, 1, 2
2, 3, 0

model = 40 50 1
view = 1 1 1
projection = ortho aspect ratio




pass vertex buffer array and index array in
create vertex array and index buffer, use DrawQuad shader
draw
delete vertex array and index buffer, clear storage of passed data


add color passing to shader
add support for complex geometry(any quadrilateral, not just rectangles)
abstract data passing for vba
refactor to use static va, vb, and ib, to prevent unneeded system drag from making new objects each draw call

pvm passing IMPORTANT!!!
